## 1️⃣ What Is the Research Process? (BIG PICTURE – EXAM FAVORITE)

### 📌 Definition (Very Important)

The **research process** is a **multi-stage, iterative sequence of actions** used to conduct **scientific inquiry**, starting from an idea and ending with published findings .

👉 In simple words:

> It is the **step-by-step journey** a researcher follows to **ask a question, find answers, and share results**.

---

### 🧠 Key Characteristics (EXAM GOLD ⭐)

Examiners LOVE these characteristics:

#### 1. **Interdependent & Overlapping**

* Each stage affects the others
* Example: While reviewing literature, you may **change your research problem**

#### 2. **Non-Linear & Iterative**

* You don’t move in a straight line
* You often **go back and revise earlier steps**

#### 3. **Anticipatory**

* Early decisions affect later stages
* Example: A poorly defined problem leads to wrong data collection

#### 4. **Guideline, Not a Prescription**

* Flexible, not rigid
* Adjusts to research context (topic, time, data access)

📌 **Exam Tip:**

> If asked *“Is the research process linear?”*
> 👉 Answer: **NO — it is iterative and non-linear**
